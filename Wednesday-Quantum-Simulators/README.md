# SeQUeNCe Simulator Hands-On

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks for the SeQUeNCe simulator hands-on session on Wednesday, June 28. 
To run each notebook, you will need to install the simulator from the separate repository [here](https://github.com/sequence-toolbox/SeQUeNCe). 
Brief instructions will be reviewed day-of for installation of the simulator, 
but a working Python installation (at least version 3.8) with `jupyter` installed is required.

To install the simulator, simply download the linked repository, navigate to its directory, and install with pip as
```
$ pip install .
```
or with the included makefile as
```
$ make install
```
These directions are also restated in the SeQUeNCe directory.
